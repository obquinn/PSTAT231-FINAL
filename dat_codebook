This dataset is a combination of two others: the "Legislative and District Data 1972-2013" set published in October 2016 by Professor Ella Foster-Molina, and the "Candidate/Recipient Database" of the "Database on Ideology, Money in Politics, and Elections (DIME)" published in August 2016 by Professor Adam Bonica. 

The first is available here: X
